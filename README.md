In this work, we present an advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for LTE cellular traffic prediction, addressing the limitations of traditional machine learning models used in previous studies. Existing methods often struggle with spatial dependencies, dynamic network topologies, and real-time adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to model the inherent graph structure of LTE networks, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships between cell towers.
We use a cleaned and preprocessed LTE dataset that includes multiple real-world mobility scenarios such as static, pedestrian, car, and bus environments. Our dataset consists of key LTE parameters such as RSRP, RSRQ, SNR, CQI, RSSI, along with geolocation data, enabling a comprehensive learning framework. The model processes LTE signals as a graph structure, where nodes represent cell towers and edges denote inter-cell connectivity based on geographical proximity.
The proposed GNN model significantly improves prediction accuracy and generalization compared to conventional machine learning methods by capturing spatial correlations within the LTE network. After 200 epochs of training, the model achieved a test accuracy of 85.98%, outperforming traditional statistical and deep learning methods in terms of both efficiency and robustness.
By introducing an effective graph-based learning mechanism, we enhance real-time traffic forecasting, adaptive network optimization, and mobility-aware resource allocation in LTE networks. The results demonstrate the practical applicability of GNNs in real-world cellular networks, making them a promising approach for next-generation 5G and beyond network architectures.
