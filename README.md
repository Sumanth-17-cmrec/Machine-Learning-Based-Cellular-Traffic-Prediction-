# Machine-Learning-Based-Cellular-Traffic-Prediction-
In this work, we present an advanced Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for LTE cellular traffic prediction, addressing the limitations of traditional machine learning models used in previous studies. Existing methods often struggle with spatial dependencies, dynamic network topologies, and real-time adaptability.
